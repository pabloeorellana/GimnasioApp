# User secrets (if using .NET user secrets)
# This path might vary depending on your OS and project setup
# If you use User Secrets for local development, it's typically outside the project folder.
# For connection strings, consider storing them securely or using User Secrets locally.
# If you explicitly have a `appsettings.Development.json` or `appsettings.json`
# with sensitive data that should NOT be pushed, you might add:
# appsettings.Development.json
# appsettings.json
# but be careful, as this might break deployment if not handled correctly.
# For database connection strings, the best practice is to use environment variables or
# a secret management service in production, and User Secrets for development.

# Exclude the project files themselves in case of copy/paste
# For example, if you see a .Web.csproj.user, you might explicitly ignore it
